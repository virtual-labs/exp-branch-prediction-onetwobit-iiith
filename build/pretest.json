      "question": "What is the purpose of a branch predictor?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To execute branches faster",
        "b": "To predict the outcome of a branch",
        "c": "To store branch instructions",
        "d": "To count the number of branches"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. While the goal is to improve performance, the specific function is prediction.",
        "b": "Correct. A branch predictor guesses the outcome of a conditional branch to keep the pipeline full.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Branch instructions are stored in memory, not by the predictor.",
        "d": "Incorrect. A branch predictor does not count branches."      },

    {
      "question": "What does a one-bit predictor use to make a prediction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A two-bit counter",
        "b": "The previous outcome of the branch",
        "c": "A random guess",
        "d": "The type of branch instruction"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. That's a two-bit predictor.",
        "b": "Correct. A one-bit predictor uses a single bit to store the last outcome.",
        "c": "Incorrect. It's a deterministic prediction based on history.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The type of instruction doesn't determine the prediction."

      "question": "How many states does a one-bit predictor have?",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. It needs to represent Taken and Not Taken.",
        "b": "Correct. The two states are Taken and Not Taken.",
        "c": "Incorrect. There are only two possible outcomes for a branch.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is the number of states for a two-bit predictor."

      "question": "What is a disadvantage of a one-bit predictor?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It is too complex",
        "b": "It is slow",
        "c": "It can be inaccurate with loops",
        "d": "It requires a lot of memory"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. It's the simplest predictor.",
        "b": "Incorrect. It's very fast.",
        "c": "Correct. It mispredicts twice for every loop execution (first and last time).",
        "d": "Incorrect. It requires very little memory."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. It uses two bits.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is for a one-bit predictor.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The number of states is 2^n where n is the number of bits.",
        "d": "Correct. The four states are Strongly Not Taken, Weakly Not Taken, Weakly Taken, and Strongly Taken."

      "question": "How many consecutive incorrect predictions does it take to change the prediction of a two-bit predictor from 'Strongly Taken' to 'Not Taken'?",

        "c": "3",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. One incorrect prediction moves it to 'Weakly Taken'.",
        "b": "Correct. It takes two consecutive 'Not Taken' outcomes to move from 'Strongly Taken' (11) to 'Weakly Not Taken' (01), thus changing the prediction.",
        "c": "Incorrect. That's too many.",
        "d": "Incorrect. That's too many."

        "a": "Incorrect. It's more complex.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The speed is comparable.",
        "c": "Correct. The two-bit scheme provides hysteresis, making it more accurate, especially with loops.",
        "d": "Incorrect. It uses more memory (two bits per branch instead of one)."

        "c": "Incorrect. '10' is 'Weakly Taken'.",
