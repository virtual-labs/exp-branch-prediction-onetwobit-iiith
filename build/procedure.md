### Procedure
1.  Select the type of predictor you want to use (One-Bit or Two-Bit).
2.  Enter the sequence of branch outcomes (T for taken, N for not taken).
3.  Click on the 'Simulate' button to see the predictor's performance.
4.  The simulation will show the initial state, the prediction for each branch, the new state after the branch, and the overall accuracy of the predictor.
5.  You can reset the simulation at any time by clicking the 'Reset' button.
